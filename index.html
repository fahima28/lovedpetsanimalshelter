                <p>
                    At Loved Pets Animal Rescue, we give rescued animals the care and second chance they deserve.
                    Every animal that comes to us is screened for diseases, washed, groomed, and then added to our
                    adoption listings so potential families can meet their new best friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also carefully screen adoptive families for their adoption history, household lifestyle, and
                    commitment to providing a safe, loving home. Our goal is to create lifelong matches that keep
                    pets happy and protected.
                </p>

                <h2>Why We Need Volunteers</h2>
                <p>
                    Loved Pets depends on volunteers to keep the shelter running. Volunteers help by bathing and
                    grooming animals, playing with pets to keep them social and happy, cleaning kennels and
                    screening rooms, and assisting with office tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’d like to make a difference, visit our Contact page to learn how to apply to volunteer.
